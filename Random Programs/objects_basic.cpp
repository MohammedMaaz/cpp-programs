// An object is any real world thing with it's own identity.
/* There are 3 dimensions that describe an object completely in object oriented programming : identity, attribute and
   behavior.
   identity is the differentiating factor of an object.
   attribute is the current state of an object but it is independent of it's type. Ex. a car can have an attribute red
   and so a mug. But car and mug are 2 different types.
   behavior is however type dependent. Ex a car moves and a mug contains some fluid etc.
