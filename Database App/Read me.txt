It is a simple Database program made with c++ filing concept.

To run the program double click the stdnt_db.exe file.

As you enter or modify records within the program they will automatically
update on an external "students_databse.txt" file.

Also due to the use of filing the data updated/recorded through the program
is permanent, i.e you donot lose the records even if the program is closed!

DON'T DELETE the files folder or anything within it otherwise you will
lose the records and the program may also missbehave.
